**Code Tour** is a ReactJS component designed for interactive code walkthroughs on the web. With Code Tour, seamlessly guide users through your codebase by passing code snippets, configuring steps to replace or highlight specific lines. Users can effortlessly navigate through each step using intuitive arrow buttons, transforming your code exploration into an engaging and dynamic slideshow experience.

## Key Features

- <strong>Dynamic Code Exploration</strong>:
  Unleash the potential of your code documentation with Code Tour's dynamic exploration feature.
